ArenaSweats is a ranked leaderboard and achievement tracker for LoL Arena gamemode.

The core of ArenaSweats, its ranked leaderboard, is powered by LOTS of data. ALL Arena matches of ALL players are tracked GLOBALLY (except China) in near real-time.

Once all game data is collected, it goes through a ranking algorithm called TrueSkill. TrueSkill is developed by Microsoft and is used in many industry-leading multiplayer games including by Riot for Summoner's Rift ranked. This is an excellent base, but Arena is a complicated game and base TrueSkill may not be sufficient. To deal with this, the ranked algorithm for ArenaSweats will always be 100% transparent and open source. And finally, any modifications that will be made to TrueSkill for ArenaSweats will be decided by the community over on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/BvGFJ4WEWg)

Through these 3 principles, the ArenaSweats ranked algorithm will stay trustworthy and as accurate as possible.

This repository's purpose is to bring these principles to life, being the real location where the source code of the LIVE leaderboard ranked algorithm lives.

**This is PROOF of ArenaSweats leaderboard integrity.**
