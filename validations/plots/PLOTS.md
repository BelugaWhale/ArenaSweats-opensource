At the moment this folder contains plots of every player plotted on games played and sigma. This is split by region and the data points are grouped to make it more readable. The purpose of this is to see how different instantiations of the ranked system effect player sigma as they player more games. 
model = ThurstoneMostellerFull(sigma=(25/5.75), beta=(25/6) * 4, tau=(25/300) * 1.75)
would be:
sigma_games_by_region {5.75}-{4}-{1.75}.html
